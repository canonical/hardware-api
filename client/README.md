# Hardware API Client

The **Hardware API Client** is the tool to check the certification status of
hardware configurations.

It consists of both the `hwlib` library and `hwctl` CLI tool.

- `hwlib`: Rust library for communicating with
  [the API server](../server/).
- `hwctl`: CLI tool leveraging the `hwlib` library.

## Basic Usage

To check the machine certification status, simply run `hwctl` with
root[^sudo] privileges:

```shell
sudo hwctl
```

To send the request to a different server than the [default][hw-server],
specify the `HW_API_URL` environment variable:

```shell
sudo HW_API_URL=https://your.server.url hwctl
```

## Installation

`hwctl` is available on all major Linux distributions.

On snap-ready systems, you can install it on the command-line with:

```shell
sudo snap install hwctl
```

On Questing Quokka (25.10), you can also install it using `apt`:

```shell
sudo apt-get install hwctl
```
