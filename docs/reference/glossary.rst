    configuration
        A "configuration" is roughly equivalent to a
        :abbr:`SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)` and represents a specific variant or
        model of a :term:`platform`. In most cases, the Ubuntu Certified status
        is assigned at the configuration level.

    platform
        A "platform" is a grouping of one or more adjacent
        :term:`configurations <configuration>`
        (i.e., :abbr:`SKUs (Stock Keeping Units)`). In some cases, the Ubuntu
        Certified status is assigned at the platform level, covering all
        included configurations.
